# 🤖 Agents – A Collection of AI-Powered Agents

This repository contains a set of independent, modular AI-powered agents.  
Each agent is designed to solve a specific use case — from automating conversations to processing data — using modern AI models and APIs.

---

## 📦 What's Inside

- Modular architecture: Each folder represents a standalone agent.
- Powered by LLMs: Built with Gemini, OpenAI, and other models.
- API integrations: Includes messaging platforms, utilities, and third-party services.
- Easily configurable: Environment variables and `requirements.txt` provided per agent.
- Ready to deploy: Each agent runs as a lightweight Flask app.

## 🧠 What is an Agent?

An agent is a self-contained Python service that:

* Uses LLMs to understand and respond to prompts
* Integrates with APIs like WhatsApp, Slack, or file tools
* Can automate responses, summarize content, or perform intelligent actions

These agents are designed for **modularity**, **scalability**, and **rapid prototyping**.

## 🛠️ Stack Highlights

* Python (Flask)
* `google-genai` / OpenAI SDK
* `requests`, `python-dotenv`
* Supports `.env` configuration for secure keys
